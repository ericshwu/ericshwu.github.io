I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI) in Renmin University of China (RUC), supervised by Prof. Rui Yan and Prof. Yankai Lin. 
My research interests focus on efficient LLMs and their mechanistic interpretability. I am dedicated to enhance the fundamental capabilities of LLMs.
