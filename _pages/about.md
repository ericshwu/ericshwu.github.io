<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/) in [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ) and [Prof. Yankai Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=j8K1FqEAAAAJ). 
My research interests focus on efficient LLMs and their mechanistic interpretability. I am dedicated to enhance the fundamental capabilities of LLMs.
